# Advent of Code 2021
Solutions to the Advent of Code 2021 problems.

Unfortunately, due to time constraints and other factors, I haven't come around
to finishing all of the problems. I currently have no plans to finish the rest,
though I may come back to it at some point in the future.

These solutions are not meant to be the most practical, performant or readable
solutions. My goal is to write the solutions in several different languages,
using their features and philosophies in what I think are fun(ny) and
interesting ways.

Each day's solution is located in `src/day-NN` where `NN` is the day number.
Since each solution may be written in a different language using different ways
of building/running, each of these folders contains a separate README file
explaining how to (build and) run. Any commands specified in those READMEs
should be run from that same folder, unless otherwise specified. The commands
should all work on bash, cmd and powershell, though on cmd you may have to
replace forward slashes in paths with backslashes.
