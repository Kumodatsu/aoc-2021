# Advent of Code 2021
Solutions to the Advent of Code 2021 problems.

These solutions are not meant to be the most practical, performant or readable
solutions. My goal is to write the solutions in several different languages,
using their features in what I think are fun and interesting ways.

Each day's solution is located in `src/day-NN` where `NN` is the day number.
Since each solution may be written in a different language using different ways
of building/running, each of these folders contains a separate README file
explaining how to (build an) run. Any commands specified in those READMEs should
be run from that same folder, unless otherwise specified.
