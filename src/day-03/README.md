# Day 3 - Binary Diagnostic with C
You can find the description of the problem [here][1].

## About the solution
Since a lot of this problem can be solved using fancy bit manipulation, C seems
like an excellent choice to solve it. Also in the spirit of C, the program is as
unreadable as possible, left completely undocumented and may or may not produce
the intended result with your choice of compiler and environment. In particular,
my compiler complains about undefined behavior on line 35 in `main.c`, but one
sometimes has to make sacrifices in order to remain concise.
